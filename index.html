                    <p>I literally made this for a game jam that was 48 hours, there was no playtesting, and all of the bears AI was made by me. Which totally ironically is the only part of the game that doesn't work perfectly. Wonder why that is. Very strange coincidence. Just look at branch battles, at least it mostly works'</p>
