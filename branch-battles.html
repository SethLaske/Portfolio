            <p>Branch Battles is a super cool game. I made it, all by myself. My parents are not proud of me.</p>
            <p>Some of the most important features you need to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am literally the only person who can beat the game</li>
                <li>The artwork was done by me, thus it is terrible</li>
                <li>I put John Wick and Dio in the game cause it was really funny</li>
            </ul>
